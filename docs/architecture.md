# 🧠 Model Architecture & Training

Guardian AI uses a **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** to learn **structural vulnerability patterns** in supply-chain graphs.

The goal is **not attack prediction**, but learning how **graph structure amplifies failure propagation**.

---

## Learning Objective

Given a supply-chain graph, the model learns to estimate:

* Which nodes contribute disproportionately to cascading impact
* Which dependency patterns increase propagation reach
* Which edges act as structural chokepoints

This is framed as a **structural risk representation task**, not classification or forecasting.

---

## Model Architecture

### Graph Neural Network (GNN)

A **GraphSAGE / GCN-style architecture** is used for simplicity and explainability.

#### Node Features

* Supplier tier (encoded)
* In-degree / out-degree
* Dependency depth
* Optional historical incident indicator

#### Edge Features

* Dependency type
* Integration category (API, data, auth, etc.)

#### Layers

1. Graph convolution layers to aggregate neighborhood structure
2. Non-linear transformations (ReLU)
3. Final embedding layer producing fixed-size node embeddings

## Training Strategy

### Dataset Preparation

* MERCOR supply-chain graphs are split into subgraphs.
* Synthetic failure propagation labels are generated by:

  * Simulating node removals
  * Measuring cascade reach
* These serve as **supervised signals** for learning amplification patterns.

### Loss Function

* Regression loss on cascade amplification score
* Encourages embeddings to encode structural risk contribution

### Training Environment

* Training is performed **offline** prior to demo.
* Model weights are saved and loaded for inference only.

This ensures:

* Training complexity does not impact demo stability
* Reproducible results

---

## Inference Usage

During runtime:

* The GNN performs **single-pass inference** on the graph.
* Outputs:

  * Node risk embeddings
  * Edge sensitivity scores

These values **guide simulation**, but do not override deterministic logic.

---

## Why This Model Choice Works

* Graphs are the natural representation of supply chains
* GNNs capture non-local structural effects
* The model learns patterns humans cannot easily reason about
* Outputs remain interpretable and bounded

---

## Key Design Constraint

Guardian AI **intentionally avoids**:

* Temporal forecasting
* Adversary behavior modeling
* Probabilistic attack prediction

This ensures the model remains **technically defensible, explainable, and hackathon-appropriate**.

---

## Final Note

The combination of:

* Real datasets (MERCOR)
* Legitimate neural learning (GNN)
* Deterministic simulation
* Agent-based reasoning
* Explainable outputs

creates a system that is **deep enough to impress experts** and **practical enough to demo live**.
